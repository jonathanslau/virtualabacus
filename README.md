# virtualabacus
 
Repository for my virtual abacus project.

The current plan is to use vanilla js and html to get to an mvp stage. Once mvp is reached, the page will be deployed. After that, additional features will be planned. I will then double back and look at available javascript frameworks that could improve readability of existing code and make future development easier.

The [wiki](https://github.com/jonathanslau/virtualabacus/wiki/Planning) contains planning information.
