# virtualabacus
 
[Deployed](http://virtual-abacus.herokuapp.com/) on heroku.

This is a personal project filling two purposes. One, as a way to learn JavaScript, front end dev, server-side dev, etc. Two, to build a tool to help keep my mental arithmetic ability sharp.

The app simulates a 4+1 row standard abacus, currently available with 4 columns (max number is 9999). It also generates addition and multiplication practice questions.

Future development will include ux improvements, addition with subtraction, division, and server-side score saving.
